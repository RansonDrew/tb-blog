So I got a new phone today an LG G4. It’s pretty sweet. At the same time I switched my mobile carrier to T-Mobile. I admit to some reservation over the decision. T-Mobile, historically, has a reputation of poor coverage. I’m happy to say that my experience so far has been pretty positive. At my house and at my parents’ house, the signal strength is excellent. I look forward to evaluating this new combo.

I have been in a training class for the last few days. It was a basic overview of the Axway MailGate appliance. I passed the exam this afternoon, so I got an Axway certification. Not sure if it will help me, but hey… it’s something.
