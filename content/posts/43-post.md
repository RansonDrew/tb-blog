It’s been a very long time since I posted anything other than a picture to this blog. I guess more entries are long overdue.

So why now? The answer is that I have been pondering an idea. The idea is to write some kind of mechanism that will grab the text from new entries to this blog and format them and apply them to my gopher phlog.

I’ve been looking into the WordPress API to do this, but I don’t really have any current text entries. To fix this, I plan to make some over the next few days.
