The title stays the same, but the content changes.

Those familiar with WordPress will know that every new installation starts with a sample post. The title of this post is “Hello World!” The post content is something about WordPress, but this is where I have made a change.

If all goes well, I’ll update this blog periodically… or not. Only time will tell.
