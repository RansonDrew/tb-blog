Well, it’s been a few days, but I’m back with another post. My therapist once gave me some advice regarding going to the gym. She told me sometimes it was good to go, even if you knew you weren’t going to do a great workout. By going regularly, you can cement the habit of going so that in the future it becomes a rote process. In this way yopu have less of a “feeling” about it. So, I’ll try to remember to post as frequently as I can, to get this blogging habit cemented.

Last night ME and I went to see the movie “Deadpool”. It was fun and I can say for certain we were entertained. We laughed… alot.

That is all.
