That’s just a reminder to myself. Tomorrow is a holiday so I need to remind myself it’s Sunday. This way I can enjoy myself more tomorrow by knowing that if not for the holiday, I would be at work.

I ordered a new phone today and plan to switch carriers.

I added a projects page to the site.

We met a lady today who is looking to catch feral cats in our area to help with the problem in Ranson.
