Most Saturdays, I go visit my friend Rob where we watch movies or sports or just sit around and gab. This week Rob was unavailable, so I’m at home tonight.

I decided to watch the X-Files. From what I understand, this is a six-episode season of new content. So far, I like it.

I’ve had some more time to evaluate my new phone. I really like it. It’s a bit bigger than I would normally like, but just a bit. It’s not so big that I feel as though I’m trying to use a tablet as a phone. More on this subject later.
